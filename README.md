# Java Migration Tool

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/YashchenkoN/assertsqlcount.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/YashchenkoN/assertsqlcount)

Simple tool allowing managing DB schema / static (reference) data via Java Code.

## Motivation
There are plenty of DB nowadays (SQL / NoSQL) but not all of them have Java libraries to manage DB schema / static data, especially if it comes to NoSQL DBs.
Popular solutions like Flyway / Liquibase don't support NoSQL DBs.
This project is aimed to develop generic tool that might be easily integrated with any type of DB.
